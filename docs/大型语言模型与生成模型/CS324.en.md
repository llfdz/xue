"CS324: Large Language Models" is a graduate-level course at Stanford University that explores the fundamentals, theory, ethics, and system aspects of large language models (LLMs). The course also offers hands-on experience in evaluating and building these models.

Massive pre-trained LLMs have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), enabling state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks and demonstrating the ability to generate fluent text and perform few-shot learning. However, these models are challenging to interpret and introduce new ethical and scalability concerns. This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of LLMs and practical exposure through projects and paper discussions.
