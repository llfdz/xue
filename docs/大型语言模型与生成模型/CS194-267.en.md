"Understanding Large Language Models: Foundations and Safety" is a Spring 2024 course at UC Berkeley, co-taught by **Professor Dawn Song** and **Dan Hendrycks**, with **Yu Gai** as the GSI. This course explores the foundational principles, interpretability, scaling laws, and risks associated with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.

The course provides a rigorous introduction to LLMs, discussing their emergence, limitations, and potential risks, as well as methods for safer and more beneficial applications. Topics covered include:

- Foundations of LLMs
- Interpretability
- Scaling laws
- Adversarial robustness
- AI alignment and governance
- Privacy, watermarking, and Trojans
- Agency, emergence, reasoning, and mathematics
- Evaluation and benchmarking
